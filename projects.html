2. FoodForHomeless:
<p2>
  Who are we as human beings if we ignore the suffering of others? <br />
ForForHomeless is a digital platform which aims to, as the name suggests, provide food to the homeless people living in Rajasthan. Over 20 crore Indians go to sleep hungry every day and 10 million people die every year of chronic hunger and hunger-related diseases and  on an average, diners leave 17 percent of their meals uneaten and 55 percent of edible leftovers are left at the restaurants. After one full day, there is a lot of food which is left at restaurants, hotels and even house parties. Instead of throwing it away, why not provide it to the needy people who donâ€™t get any food to eat? This is exactly what FoodForHomeless envisions. By just following a few steps, you can help a one more person in India to go to sleep with a happy and full stomach.<br />
(The website will be up soon)<br /><br />
