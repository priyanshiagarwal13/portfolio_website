   <b>ABOUT ME</b>
  </h6>
<p>
  Hey! I am Priyanshi Agarwal. I was born in Jaipur which is also known as the 'Pink City' of India. I am currently
studying computer science (specialising in computer and communication engineering) at Manipal Institute of Technology, Karnataka. I did my high school in Neerja Modi School, Jaipur. <br /><br />
I'm interested in exploring different domains of computer science such as web development, Software Development, UI/UX, AR/VR, cloud computing, Blockchain Technologies, etc. From my perspective, computer science has the potential to transform every major industry and build the improbable. Through all these years, I have seen how this field brims with opportunity for creativity and innovation. This stimulated me to pursue Computer Science, with the ardent desire of imagining and creating something of my own, as well as contributing something to support people.<br /> <br />
I have tried to build various projects with the help of online courses, instructors, google, etc . I have built a web application for online examinations along with gratis practice tests using PHP, CSS, JavaScript and HTML,
to aid institutions in conducting examinations during COVID-19; I identified a problem and came up with a technological solution to address it. I have also built a website using JS, CSS and HTML which I used as a platform to express my creative writing skills.  Furthermore, I have designed a to-do app during my SwiftUI masterclass and also an rgp text battle game using Python, to procure more experience in the field of coding. In addition to this, I am currently working on my idea to build a platform 'FoodForHomeless' which allows restaurants and hotels to donate excess food to the homeless.<br /> <br />
From volunteering at a school for the visuallyimpaired  (Rajasthan Netraheen Vidyalaya), the IC3 college fair, etc, I have acquired important values such as empathy, patience, gratitude, responsibility and wisdom. Additionally, by being the President of various MUNs, the head of the social media committee at school and the head of the technical team of TEDxYOUTH@NMS, I have enhanced my research abilities while gaining leadership, teamwork, collaborative, oratory and problem solving skills.
Currently, I am working as a member of the working committee of IEEE Student Branch Manipal. In IEEE SBM, I am working under the coding and web dev working committees. <br /> <br />Additionally, my team won the ideathon "Epiphany" which was organized by GirlScript Manipal. In addition to that, I became the member/campus hero for the GirlScript foundation. I am also working as the member of the technical team of The Mit Post. <br /><br />
Apart from the aforementioned, I would love to explore new cultures and interact with diverse communities from all backgrounds.
